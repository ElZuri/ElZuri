## English
This is the first HTML project by ElZuri where it will be a documentation of all the content that will be offered and developed.

ElZuri is currently one person known as Zuri, who over time will have more people collaborating on different types of projects. These projects are divided into the following:

- ZuriEducacion: Will be responsible for all the free educational content that I will share to improve learning in Latin America.
- ZuriVideojuegos: Creation of video games.
- ZuriProducciones: Creation of AudioVisual and Graphic content.

This is the first README where I put the initial ideas that I will develop and update.
